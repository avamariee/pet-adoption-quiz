> #### **Problem**
> - Over-population of pets in animal shelters.
> - Over-breeding, resulting in more people purchasing animals instead of adopting homeless pets.
>
> #### **Solution**
> - Users will engage in a fun interactive quiz that will gauge whether or not the user is a dog or a cat person.
> - Each question will also display a random cat or dog, powered by https://thecatapi.com/ & https://dog.ceo/dog-api/.
> - Upon achieving either result, the user will then be presented with adoption vs breeding statistics, and a list of either cat or dog adoptions in their area, powered by Petfinder.
> - The user's results will also be saved into local storage, and generated into an email message so they can share results with a friend. 
> - The end goal will to be making users more aware of how important it is to adopt animals from shelters.
