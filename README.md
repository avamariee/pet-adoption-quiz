# pet-adoption-quiz
> - This is a group project by Ava Bullock, Janell Myrick, Tess Austin and Luisianna Barrios. 
> - There was a button styling contribution by user: rishabh341.

### **Problem**
> Over-population of pets in animal shelters.
> Over-breeding, resulting in more people purchasing animals instead of adopting homeless pets.
>
### **Solution**
> - The main page of our website contains facts and informational links where users can find more statistics and adoption information if they choose to view it.
> - When the user clicks the “start” button, they will engage in a fun interactive quiz that will gauge whether or not the user is a dog or a cat person.
> - Each question will also display a random cat or dog image, powered by https://unsplash.com/ & https://dog.ceo/dog-api/.
> - The user's results will also be saved into local storage,  which will be used at the end of the quiz. Upon completion  the user will be presented with their customized link to petfinder.com so they can see adoptions in their area. 
> - The end goal will be to maker users more aware of how important it is to adopt animals from shelters.
